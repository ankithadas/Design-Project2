	abstract = {Abstract Control of Rotary Inverted Pendulum (RIP) is a classic control problem. It represents a broader class of underactuated systems. The dynamical equations of RIP are nonlinear coupled and complex. The nonlinear feature and the complex internal dynamics makes the design of the control challenging. This paper presents swing up and stabilization both via sliding modes. Tracking control of rotary actuator using sliding modes is developed for swing up of RIP till the pendulum reaches in the linear region around the vertical upright position. Once it reaches in the linear region, a stabilization control using sliding mode is switched on. A linear model of the RIP is used for developing the SMC law for stabilization. Effectiveness of the method is validated in simulation as well as by experiment.},

The behavior obtained with the strategy depends critically on the ratio of the maximum acceleration of the pivot to the acceleration of gravity. A comparison with with minimum time strategies gives interesting insights into the robustness issues.},

The goal is to balance the pendulum in the inverted position. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed controllers with regard to parameter variations, noise effects, and load disturbances. The proposed methods can be considered as promising ways for control of various similar nonlinear systems.},
